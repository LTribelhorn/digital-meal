# Digital Meal Portability

This sub-application is used to connect Digital Meal with portability APIs of external platforms (e.g., TikTok).

## Development

### Prerequisits

- A TikTok Developer account with a sandbox project
- ngrok installed to gate the response retrieved from TikTok to the locally hosted application

### How-To

1. Start an ngrok connection in a PowerShell: `ngrok http 8000 --url https://eager-mayfly-united.ngrok-free.app`
2. Run the Django development server

This setup will forward the traffic received by ngrok to the locally hosted application.


## TikTok

### Authentication Flow

- Send User to Login Page
- Receive authorization code from TikTok
- Get access token from TikTok with authorization code

### Settings and Environment Variables

To integrate the portability module in a Django application, the following settings must be defined in the
settings/environment variables:

- TIKTOK_AUTH_URL: Link to TikTok's authorization page (optional; defaults to 'https://www.tiktok.com/v2/auth/authorize/')
