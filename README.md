# Digital Meal

Digital Meal is a web-based learning and teaching tool. The goal of the overarching Digital Meal project is to 
provide teachers with materials and an interactive tool to discuss and foster the media literacy of their students.

The core idea of Digital Meal is to foster media literacy by 

1. instructing students how they can request and download the data digital platforms such as Google/YouTube/Instagram/etc. have 
stored about them (e.g., through the [Google takeout page](https://takeout.google.com/settings/takeout)),
2. provide them an application to generate personalized usage reports based on the data they have requested from a platform,
3. and providing learning and teaching material to guide (self-)reflections and discussions of personal media use but 
also media use in general.

## Used Frameworks

Digital Meal is a Python/Django application. It is developed to be used in 
tandem with [django-ddm](https://github.com/uzh/ddm), a web-application to collect 
data donations and enrich them with questionnaire responses. 

## Usage

Currently, this repository is developed for internal use and is not yet optimized 
to be easily applicable to other projects/use cases.
